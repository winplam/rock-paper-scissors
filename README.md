# Project: Rock Paper Scissors

The classic Rock Paper Scissors game we're all familiar with from childhood remade into JavaScrip application and played against an adorable AI.
The game was initial created with only a text based UI and then latter on pretty graphics and button animations were added.
Special attention was given finding just the right clip art images and make the colors and CSS styles pleasing to the eye.
The JavaScript code is kept organized by separating short, related functionality into individual functions.   
The scoreboard keeps track the score and highlights the winner of each draw.

@media queries were used to give the page some responsiveness although more work will need to be done to make it truly mobile friendly.
